# LibreTutor API

API for LibreTutor made using Node.js.

# What does this API do?

Currently, this API controls the search component (for the pupils)
and it is responsible for creating, reading, updating and deleting 
all the tutors. It also contains the model for the tutors.

# For the future

In the future, I will create a new version only for the pupils and
leave this version for managing the tutors (I will migrate the
search algorithm from here to there).

I'll also implement an authentication algorithm for both versions 
so I can use it in the front end.

# How can I contribute to this open-source project?
