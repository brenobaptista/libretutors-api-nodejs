# LibreTutor API

API for LibreTutor made using Node.js.

# What does this API do?

Currently, this API controls the search component (for the pupils)
and it is responsible for creating, reading, updating and deleting 
all the tutors. It also contains the model for the tutors.

# For the future

In the future, I will create the CRUD and model for the pupils and 
I'll also implement an authentication algorithm so I can use it in 
the front end (login screen).

# How can I contribute to this open-source project?
